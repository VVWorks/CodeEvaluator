# CodeEvaluator
An open source program that allows you to evaluate your code with sample tests.

# Important:
   -This program does not compile your code, you have to do this yourself, it tests the executable. 
   -Do not try to test unknown executables, otherwise it could be harmufull for your system.
 
# How to use:
   First copy your inputs in the *TESTS/INPUTS* folder and outputs in the *TESTS/OUTPUT* folder. Then use the command *update* to link the tests with the program. You can view certain tests, deactivate them and so on. To see the commands for doing this type *help*. Next, you should link your executable as well using the command 
add(path, name). You can link how many programs you want just make sure to name them differently. To test a program use the command *evy* or *evn* (more about them in the help menu). You also have control under a set of parameters like execution time limit, number of tests, number of programs.
